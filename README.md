# VGG_Style_Transfer

This notebook provides image preprocessing functions and classes for the style transfer task. It also makes use of VGG pretrained model layers to implement the style transfer from an input image to target image. The entire process from preprocessing to optimization was carried out using TensorFlow in Google Colab (GPU).
